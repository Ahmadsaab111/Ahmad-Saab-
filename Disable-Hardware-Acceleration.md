As of RuneLite Launcher 1.5.1, RuneLite attempts to enable hardware acceleration based on your operating system. If you are having hardware-acceleration issues (such as artifacting) you can disable it by following the instructions below.

## .bat script to disable ddraw

If you are on Windows using the official installer, download and run this:

[Runelite-NoDDraw.bat](files/runelite-no-ddraw.bat)

## Disabling hardware acceleration on other platforms

If you downloaded the `.jar` version of the launcher, simply run:

```
java -jar RuneLite.jar --mode=OFF
```

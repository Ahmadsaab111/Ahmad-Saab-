This plugin plays a metronome that can be set to a specific tick delay to aid in efficient skilling.

## Metronome Configuration

**1. Tick Count**

(Default 1) Sets the number of ticks in between metronome beats.

**2. Enable Tock**

(Default Off) Enables alternating metronome beats to differentiate between cycles of ticks.

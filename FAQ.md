## Common Bugs
See [[Troubleshooting problems with the client]]

## Feature Requests
See [[Rejected or Rolled Back Features]]

## How do I enable XP drops and zoom unlimiter?
We use the game's xp drops and zoom system, so enable those in the game. The zoom unlimiter plugin works by unlimiting the game's zoom feature.  
See [[XP Drop]] and [[Camera Zoom]]

## How do I use inventory tags?
See [[Inventory Tags]]

## How can I configure shift click or swap menu entries?
See [[Menu Entry Swapper]]

## What is open source?
RuneLite being open source means that the code can be inspected by anybody.  
Changes to our software, that anyone can submit, are passed through an audit and acceptance process, where we make sure that the changes don't contain any malicious or rule-breaking code. This makes sure that you won't be running such code.

## Will using RuneLite get me banned?
No. However, you must be using the official RuneLite client. Be careful of unofficial and malicious clients.

## How often is RuneLite updated?
If you're using the launcher, count on seeing updates every week on Thursday. These Thursday releases are done after the game has updated, and can take a few hours if there has been an engine change in the game.

## Where can I find the logs, screenshots, or configurations?
To find logs, either open screenshot directory (by right-clicking "Camera" button) and navigate 1 directory up and then open logs folder, or navigate to `%userprofile%\.runelite\logs` on Windows or `$HOME/.runelite/logs` on Linux and macOS.

## How do I build RuneLite?
See [[Building with IntelliJ IDEA]].

## Will there be a Runelite mobile client?
No. [See this.](https://twitter.com/RuneLiteClient/status/1057301530569777154)

The GPU plugin requires **Windows (7, 8, or 10)**, a GPU with support for OpenGL 4.3 or newer, and 2GB of VRAM. This requires either an Nvidia GeForce 400 or newer, an AMD Radeon HD 5000 Series or newer, or Intel HD Graphics with an Intel Haswell processor or newer. Also ensure that your GPU drivers are up to date.

There are possibly configurations it does not work correctly on. In particular, we recommend you do not enable it in dangerous situations ingame (HCIM!) until you sufficiently test that it is stable on your system.

**How do I get GPU plugin?**
Exit your client and launch it again to update. Ensure you are using a supported operating system and graphics card (see above). You can then enable the plugin "GPU" on the plugin sidebar.

**Why can't I click as far as I saw before?**
Click distance has been limited to 45 tiles.

**Why am I getting black boxes around tiles?**
Currently there are some issues with integrated graphics cards. You can try updating your drivers and see if that fixes it.
If you have a dedicated card and are still seeing this issue see [how to set gpu app on Windows 10](https://pureinfotech.com/set-gpu-app-windows-10/)

**My stretched fixed mode is broken!**
Currently the GPU plugin does not work with the stretched mode plugin. It is a known issue and planned for a future release. No ETA.

**When will there be support for mac/linux?**
The gpu plugin is Windows only for now. The RuneLite team wants it to be available to other operating systems, it is a work in progress with no ETA.

**What is the maximum draw distance?**
90 tiles.

**Why can't I see all the way to 90 tiles?**
The client will only display loaded regions regardless of draw distance settings.

**Why doesn't RuneLite draw extra regions?**
It is being considered as an improvement, no ETA.

**Where is the skybox?**
Skybox and fog are not in the initial release. They are being worked on by a few developers already. No ETA.

**Why can't my camera fly around?**
The Orb of Oculus functionality is not part of the GPU plugin.

Jagex has requested removal of certain features, and current discussion of feature requests on Discord and GitHub concluded that RuneLite's stance on these features are as follows:

#### Removed in the past
* AoE Plugin: Removed at Jagex's request (see [1.2.13 blog](https://runelite.net/blog/show/2018-01-25-1.2.13-Release))
* In-game Zulrah Helper: Removed at Jagex's request (see [1.2.13 blog](https://runelite.net/blog/show/2018-01-25-1.2.13-Release), relevant discussion in [#1386](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/issues/1386))
* Volcanic Mine Helper: Removed at Jagex's request (see [1.2.13 blog](https://runelite.net/blog/show/2018-01-25-1.2.13-Release))
* Dynamic Puro-Puro Spawns:  Not supported by other 3rd party clients. Removed because this could be too powerful (see [#2371](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/issues/2371))
* Barbarian Assault Plugin: Left-click calling removed (see [#859](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/pull/859))

#### Not currently being considered
* RuneLite XP Drops: The vanilla client already has XP drops that can be repositioned/recolored (see [#1102](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/issues/1102))
* OpenGL: Jagex is working on their own implementation (see [#1165](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/issues/1165))
* Spellbook Re-ordering: Other 3rd party clients do not have this feature and it failed a Jagex poll (see [#1038](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/issues/1038))
* World Hopping Shortcuts: Not possible to implement without faking user input (see [#1617](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/issues/1617))
* Highlighting "Offline" Friends: Not included to respect players with their messaging mode set to Private (see [#951](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/pull/951))
* Mouse Keys: You may only use your operating system's official default mouse keys program. (see [Jagex Staement](https://services.runescape.com/m=news/mouse-keys---changes--clarification?oldschool=1))

#### Menu Entry Swapping
* `Deposit X/Withdraw X/Swapping on equipment screen`: Too powerful to implement. Jagex will implement if they want to (see [#1647](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/issues/1647))
* `Pickpocket` on non-H.A.M. members: Not supported by other 3rd party clients, and absurdly powerful when blackjacking
* `Build/Remove` on POH hotspots: This would allow zero-movement Construction skilling without special cursor positioning (try [this method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9AZWsDfo1I) instead)

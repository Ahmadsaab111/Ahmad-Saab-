Jagex has requested removal of certain features, and current discussion of feature requests on Discord and GitHub concluded that RuneLite's stance on these features are as follows:
* AoE Plugin: Removed at Jagex's request (see [1.2.13 blog](https://runelite.net/blog/show/2018-01-25-1.2.13-Release))
* In-game Zulrah Helper: Removed at Jagex's request (see [1.2.13 blog](https://runelite.net/blog/show/2018-01-25-1.2.13-Release), relevant discussion in [#1386](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/issues/1386))
* Killcount Chat Command: It is too hard to prove when you have gotten a kill. Probably will have to wait for Jagex to release an API for this (see [#306](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/issues/306))
* OSBuddy GE Prices: Would add a dependency on a closed source, proprietary, and undocumented third-party API (see [#733](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/issues/733))
* OpenGL: Jagex is working on their own implementation (see [#1165](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/issues/1165))
* Runelite XP Drops: The vanilla client already has XP drops that can be repositioned/recolored (see [#1102](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/issues/1102))
* Spellbook Re-ordering: Other 3rd party clients do not have this feature and it failed a Jagex poll (see [#1038](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/issues/1038))
* Volcanic Mine Helper: Removed at Jagex's request (see [1.2.13 blog](https://runelite.net/blog/show/2018-01-25-1.2.13-Release))

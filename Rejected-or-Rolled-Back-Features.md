Jagex has requested removal of certain features, and current discussion of feature requests on Discord and GitHub concluded that RuneLite's stance on these features are as follows:
* AoE Plugin: Removed at Jagex's request (see [1.2.13 blog](https://runelite.net/blog/show/2018-01-25-1.2.13-Release))
* In-game Zulrah Helper: Removed at Jagex's request (see [1.2.13 blog](https://runelite.net/blog/show/2018-01-25-1.2.13-Release), relevant discussion in [#1386](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/issues/1386))
* OSBuddy GE Prices: Would add a dependency on a closed source, proprietary, and undocumented third-party API (see [#733](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/issues/733))
* OpenGL: Jagex is working on their own implementation (see [#1165](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/issues/1165))
* Runelite XP Drops: The vanilla client already has XP drops that can be repositioned/recolored (see [#1102](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/issues/1102))
* Spellbook Re-ordering: Other 3rd party clients do not have this feature and it failed a Jagex poll (see [#1038](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/issues/1038))
* Volcanic Mine Helper: Removed at Jagex's request (see [1.2.13 blog](https://runelite.net/blog/show/2018-01-25-1.2.13-Release))

#### Menu Entry Swapping
* `Deposit X/Withdraw X`: Too powerful to implement. Jagex will implement if they want to (see [#1647](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/issues/1647))
* `Pickpocket`: Not supported by other clients, and absurdly powerful when blackjacking
* `Build/Remove` on POH hotspots: This would allow zero-movement Construction skilling without special cursor positioning (try [this method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9AZWsDfo1I) instead)

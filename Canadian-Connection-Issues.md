**__Possible workarounds:__**
- Use a VPN when launching RuneLite (it can be turned off before logging in to the game)
- Use your mobile phone's internet to launch RuneLite (WiFi or USB tethering)
- Manually change your DNS server
- Use the normal OSRS client

**Steps to use a VPN**
1) Download a free VPN (for instance ProtonVPN)
2) Set your country to the United States
3) Launch RuneLite with the VPN activated
4) Disconnect from the VPN before logging in to the game
5) Log in to the game as normal
6) If you close the client, you'll have to repeat steps 3-5 every time until the problem has been resolved for Canada

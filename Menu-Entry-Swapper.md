## Options

Each toggle will swap the default option that is displayed when hovering over an in game object.

For example:
If you want to select the bank option instead of the talk option then turn on the Bank toggle. This will make it so that all bankers will bank on left click instead of talk-to.

## Shift-Click Configuration

Enter Shift-click Configuration mode by right-clicking on the Inventory icon and selecting "Configure Shift-click". When in shift click configuration mode you will notice a * next to one option on every item. This is the shift click default. Simple click on an option to change the default. Make sure to exit configuration mode the same way you got into it.

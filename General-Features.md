The RuneLite settings can be found as a plugin. See [RuneLite](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/RuneLite) for more information about the various settings the client has to offer.

RuneLite incorporates functions such as:
* Moving overlays

## Moving overlays
It's possible to move overlays and infoboxes by holding the **Alt key** and dragging them to a desired position. Whilst dragging blue squares will show fixed positions where they can be locked in.

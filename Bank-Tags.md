Enables tagging of bank items and searching of bank tags

### Setting Tags

On right-clicking items within the bank, an "Edit-tags" menu option is added, showing the number of associated tags (if any)

Upon selecting the "Edit-tags" option, the tags will be displayed in a text input in the chat box. Tags are stored as a comma-separated string. (eg. "tag1,tag2" will set the two tags, _`tag1`_ and _`tag2`_)

### Searching Tags

When using the bank search feature, tags are automatically included in the search term. To search exclusively for bank tagged items, prefix the search term with "tag:"

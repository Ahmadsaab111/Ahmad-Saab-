# FPS Control Configuration

Saves computer resources by limiting frames per second, and displays current fps.

## Settings

### Limit Global FPS

Caps frames per second to the `Global FPS target` when `Limit Global FPS` is enabled.

### Limit FPS Unfocused

Caps frames per second to the `Unfocused FPS target` when the client is not in focus (i.e. in the background), and `Limit FPS Unfocused` is enabled.

Good for saving computer resources while doing low intensity activities like fishing.

### Draw FPS indicator

Just like the ::DisplayFPS command, this will display an FPS counter in the top right-hand corner of the client.

## Notes

* This plugin used to be able to extend the logout timer past 5 minutes. This is no longer possible, use the [[Logout Timer]] plugin instead.

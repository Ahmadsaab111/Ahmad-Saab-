### 1. Limit Mode [Never, Unfocused, Always]

`Having the 'Unfocused' setting on will benefit users who use laptops or need to save resources when not focusing on the client.`

* (Default) The setting 'Never' will never limit the FPS of the client.
* The setting 'Unfocused' will only limit the FPS when the client isn't in focus.
* The setting 'Always' will always limit the FPS of the client when in focus or not.

### 2. FPS Target [Edit Number]

* (Default 50) This number is the FPS limit of the client, 50 will limit the client to 50 FPS (Frames per second).

### 3. Draw FPS indicator

* (Default On) Just like the ::DisaplyFPS command, this will display an FPS counter in the top right-hand corner of the client.

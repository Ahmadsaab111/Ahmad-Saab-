So, you're gaining some experience but it's not showing it? Here's why!

Rune Lite doesn't (as of the moment at least) have a custom Plugin content for XP Drops, Rune Lite currently uses the default xp drop system, which by itself has lots of customization, which is also perhaps the reason why not to re-create the wheel so to speak.

Anyways, here's some picture snippets on how to add your experience drops if they're not showing.

You can further customize your orb entirely via the XP Glove plugin, here's my plugin settings for that!

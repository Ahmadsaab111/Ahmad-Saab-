Hello, with this page I attempt to help developers integrate their UI designs into our global client look and feel, which we call Obsidian Theme.

## What is the Obsidian Theme?
Obsidian is a new theme for the RuneLite client that attempts to give it a unified modern look, it was initially designed by me (@psikoi) in April 2018 and currently maintained by me and hopefully you! This theme is darker, flatter, simpler and re-used UI elements to ease the user experience with familiarity. It is inspired by Google's Material Design guidelines and various modern flat design guidelines.



## Elements


### Colors

**DARKER_GRAY_COLOR: rgb(30, 30, 30)** <br> This color is to be used on section/element backgrounds that overlay the base plugin background. This is also the color of the client's border.

**DARK_GRAY_COLOR: rgb(40, 40, 40)** <br> This color is to be used as the background color for the plugin panels.

**MEDIUM_GRAY_COLOR: rgb(77, 77, 77)** <br> This color is to be used as a medium tone for any gray highlights, also used as the background color for the grand exchange elements (search, offers)

**LIGHT_GRAY_COLOR: rgb(165, 165, 165)** <br> This color is to be used as a gray alternative to white text color. When you have two labels or two sections of text and you want to set a hierarchy of importance, have the least important section be a light gray, to allow the other to stand out more in white.

**BRAND_ORANGE: rgb(220, 138, 0)** <br> This color is to be used as a highlight for many elements, it is the bright color that serves as a counter-part to all the dark gray. (Ex: Material Tab selection, Config switchers)

**PROGRESS_COMPLETE_COLOR: rgb(55, 240, 70)** <br> This color is generally used as a green color for progress bars, but could also be used for any other scenario that it works in. (Ex: it is also used as the green color for the "save" button in the screen marker plugin)

**PROGRESS_ERROR_COLOR: rgb(230, 30, 30)** <br> This color is generally used as a red color for progress bars, but could also be used for any other scenario that it works in. (Ex: it is also used as the red color for the "cancel" button in the screen marker plugin)

**PROGRESS_INPROGRESS_COLOR: rgb(230, 150, 30)** - This color is generally used as an orange color for progress bars, but could also be used for any other scenario that it works in.

### Coding Format

See [contributing.md](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#format) for the latest suggested format, which at the time is:
* Tabs, not spaces.
* Brace placement is always next line.

# Imports

InteliJ's default Code Style will optimise and order imports. To disable re-ordering of imports, remove the section in the Import Layout list. Also remove the entries in _Packages to Use Import with '*'_ to stop the replacement of java.Canvas with java.*

These are important when making changes in the runescape-client module as it will affect the deobfuscator.

# Logout Timer Configuration

This plugin changes how long you can be idle before the game logs you out. The minimum is 5 minutes, and the maximum is 25 minutes.

## Notes

- Runelite can notify you when you are about to be idle logged in the [Idle Notifier](Idle-Notifier.md) plugin.
- The "1fps trick" for extending the logout timer no longer works. Use this plugin instead.

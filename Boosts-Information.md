## Boosts Information Plugin Configuration  
The Boosts Information plugin will give you useful information about stat boosts and drains in the top-left of the game window  
By default, the panel will show the boosted stats in a list, in `boostedlevel`/`level` format

If enabled, the stat boost will display as `+number` your stat is **currently boosted by**, rather than your boosted level

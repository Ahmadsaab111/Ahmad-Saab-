## Settings

### 1. Enable Skill Boosts

(Default On) This shows your skill boosts (Fishing, Firemaking etc...) as well as your combat skill boosts.

### 2. Use Relative Boosts

(Default Off) When enabled this stops displaying your boosted stat level and instead displays the amount you have increased or decreased (e.g +4/-4).

### 3. Display as indicators.

(Default Off) When enabled, this will display your boosts as icon boxes, instead of a text list.

### 4. Display next change

(Default On) Displays a countdown from 60 seconds (1 minute), indicating when stats are naturally restored by 1.  The first 60 seconds of an initial boost (or drain) will be inaccurate, as the boost timer syncronises with the in-game timer only after reading the first stat restoration. Thus, a one-off boost of +1 (such as a skillcape boost) will not be accurately syncronised (unless the boost is henceforth repeatedly activated).  "Display next buff" appears after a stat boost (such as an Attack potion); "Display next debuff" appears after a drain (such as a Saradomin Brew).

### 5. Boost Amount Threshold

(Default 0) The number of boosted levels at which to send a notification when reached; 0 disables a notification.

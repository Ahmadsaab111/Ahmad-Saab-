## Settings

### 1. Enable Skill Boosts

(Default On) This shows your skill boosts (Fishing, Firemaking etc...) as well as your combat skill boosts.

### 2. Use Relative Boosts

(Default Off) When enabled this stops displaying your boosted stat level and instead displays the amount you have increased or decreased (e.g +4/-4).

### 3. Display as indicators.

(Default Off) When enabled, this will display your boosts in separate skill boxes, instead of a list view.

### 4. Display next change

(Default On) Displays a countdown from 60 seconds (1 minute). Once 60 seconds has passed, the boosted skill will increase or decrease 1 stat closer to your original skill stat level.

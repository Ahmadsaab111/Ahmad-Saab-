# To access the Beta worlds when using RuneLite:

    If your launcher version is older than 2.6.3, download and reinstall RuneLite from the [RuneLite homepage](https://runelite.net). You will not lose your settings or plugins from reinstalling RuneLite.

2. Run `RuneLite (configure)` from the Windows start menu:

3. Add the following to the `Client arguments` input box:
```
--jav_config=https://oldschool285.runescape.com/jav_config.ws
```

Do not modify the code, and do not modify any of the other settings.

4. Click `Save`

Now you can launch RuneLite either directly or via the Jagex Launcher and access the beta worlds.

To access the main worlds again, you will have to run the same steps but empty the `Client arguments` field.

## Notice: The development snapshot is not intended to be a stable version, there may be bugs between Thursday releases. [Please report any bugs on our issue tracker](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/issues/new/choose)!

As Runelite is developed from week to week, various features will be finished before the Thursday release and can be tested by running on the latest development snapshot version. This is possible by modifying your Runelite shortcut (see: [Creating a shortcut to disable hardware acceleration](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Disable-Hardware-Acceleration#method-1-creating-a-shortcut-and-then-adding---modeoff-without-quotes-at-the-end-of-the-target-box-video-below)) to add the `--version=[1.0-SNAPSHOT,)` flag:

Once this is done, it will download the latest development version on each launch, allowing you to test the newest features that have completed development.

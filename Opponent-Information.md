Show a widget containing the name of the NPC you are currently fighting, its current and total hitpoints, and, if in multi, the player the NPC is currently targeting. NOTICE! The current hp might not be 100% accurate, some NPCs might show a percentage instead of an hp value if we don't have the data on that specific NPC.
